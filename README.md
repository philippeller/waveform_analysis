# waveform_analysis

* use with `jupyer-notebook` or `jupyer-lab`. This will require an installation of jupyer. I recommend using the Anaconda distribution. Follow installation instructions here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

To get this code onto your computer, do `git clone git@github.com:philippeller/waveform_analysis.git`

to use it:
* `cd waveform_analysis`
* `jupyter-lab`
* keep that running and open a web broswer and point it to the right place (will be shown in the output of above command, most liley something like `localhost:8888`)
